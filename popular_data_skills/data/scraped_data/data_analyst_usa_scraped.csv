              We build our platform on top of Vitess, built by our co-founders at YouTube and Google. We also provide enterprise support for customers running Vitess in their environment.

To support both our cloud platform and enterprise customers, the Customer Engineering team leads the way. We are looking for a Customer Engineer to anchor our team.

What's the job to be done?
You will triage and prioritize customer issues, while collaborating with our Technical Account Management and Support teams.You will work on finding the root cause for high priority customer issues, designing and implementing code fixes in our codebase, while collaborating as necessary with our core Engineering teams.
These attributes best describe you…
You have excellent debugging and troubleshooting skills; with a mix of enough experience and intuition to zero in on root-causes for bugs that can leave others stumped.You are comfortable stepping outside your comfort zone. Be it delving into unfamiliar code in Vitess, one of its dependencies, or a random MySQL connector, written in a language you may not know (yet!). Working with code as your main source of documentation doesn't fluster you, and you are happy to help add/correct it as necessary where it may be inaccurate.You can operate independently, but you know when you are in too deep and need to ask for help before going down a rabbit hole for days (or weeks!).You know how to work under pressure in times of urgency. We and our customers both take issues with their data platform seriously.You have good customer-facing skills. Even though your primary task isn't interacting directly with customers, we do believe in high-bandwidth engineer-to-engineer interaction with customers, where necessary, to troubleshoot issues.
What You Will Need
Experience deploying and running (or helping customers deploy and run) databases and applications, at scaleExperience with MySQLWorking knowledge of KubernetesProgramming experience: Golang preferred; but deep experience in back-end server or systems programming at some point in your career, preferably on mission-critical, concurrent code.
What Else Will Help You Be Successful
Knowledge of common application deployment platforms and frameworks. Our customers use all kinds of languages and frameworks to speak to Vitess / PlanetScale. While no-one can possibly be fluent with all of them, knowledge of a few can be super-useful.Experience working in a remote organizationBasic knowledge of open source development and communities
At PlanetScale we believe in supporting people to do their best work and thrive no matter the location. Our mission is to build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company. We strive to build an inclusive environment where all people feel that they are equally respected and valued, whether they are a candidate or an employee. We welcome applicants of any educational background, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, age, citizenship, socioeconomic status, disability, pregnancy status, and veteran status.

To support both our cloud platform and enterprise customers, the Customer Engineering team leads the way. We are looking for a Customer Engineer to anchor our team.

What's the job to be done?
You will triage and prioritize customer issues, while collaborating with our Technical Account Management and Support teams.You will work on finding the root cause for high priority customer issues, designing and implementing code fixes in our codebase, while collaborating as necessary with our core Engineering teams.

Working with code as your main source of documentation doesn't fluster you, and you are happy to help add/correct it as necessary where it may be inaccurate.You can operate independently, but you know when you are in too deep and need to ask for help before going down a rabbit hole for days (or weeks!).You know how to work under pressure in times of urgency. We and our customers both take issues with their data platform seriously.You have good customer-facing skills. Even though your primary task isn't interacting directly with customers, we do believe in high-bandwidth engineer-to-engineer interaction with customers, where necessary, to troubleshoot issues.
What You Will Need
Experience deploying and running (or helping customers deploy and run) databases and applications, at scaleExperience with MySQLWorking knowledge of KubernetesProgramming experience: Golang preferred; but deep experience in back-end server or systems programming at some point in your career, preferably on mission-critical, concurrent code.
What Else Will Help You Be Successful
Knowledge of common application deployment platforms and frameworks. Our customers use all kinds of languages and frameworks to speak to Vitess / PlanetScale. While no-one can possibly be fluent with all of them, knowledge of a few can be super-useful.Experience working in a remote organizationBasic knowledge of open source development and communities
At PlanetScale we believe in supporting people to do their best work and thrive no matter the location. Our mission is to build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company. We strive to build an inclusive environment where all people feel that they are equally respected and valued, whether they are a candidate or an employee.

              Built on meritocracy, our unique company culture rewards self-starters and those who are committed to doing what is best for our customers.

We think of ourselves as a team, so we have teammates - not employees. We strive to attract people who are competitive, driven, and disciplined.

Brown & Brown Insurance is seeking an experienced professional to join us as a Data Analyst. This is a full time, benefits eligible remote position.

The Data Analyst will be responsible for supporting the national EBTech team in the accurate and timely movement of data between customer payroll/HCM and benefits administration software systems. Most of EBTech customers need to keep data synchronous between the benefits administration software we deploy and support, and the payroll/HCM software that the customer also utilizes. The successful completion of assigned tasks ensures that our customer’s employees receive access to, or are removed from, insurance coverage in a timely manner. In addition, chosen benefits often include payroll deductions for employees, so deductions calculated in benefits administration must be accurately reflected in payroll for proper processing. This is critical for EBTech’s ongoing success. As a Data Analyst, you are responsible for ensuring that tasks are completed on-time with high quality and timeliness. The Data Analyst will work closely with the Software Integration team and other team members in overseeing the completion of all assigned tasks.

Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here.

Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great.

Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle.
