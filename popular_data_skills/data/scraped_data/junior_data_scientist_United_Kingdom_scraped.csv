Smile Identity builds trust.

Digital Identity is core to modern life and governs everything from banking and payments to social relationships and information access. More than 500 million Africans do not have a valid form of identification, thus excluding them from participating in various sectors of the economy.

We believe access to a digital lifestyle should not be limited by one's ID card or country of origin.

Our team is diverse, spanning across 5 offices, 11 countries and 8 time zones with unique perspectives on the problems we are attempting to solve. We work mostly remotely, with regular opportunities to meet both in person at designated office spaces and outside of work for social team activities.

              About Teller Teller is a banking API with a hard technical USP. Whilst other banking APIs screen scrape html pages, we reverse engineer banks apps to discover their secret API contracts and then implement clients for them. This approach means our API enables our customers to build applications that connect with their users’ bank accounts in a manner that is many more times reliable, predictable, performant, and fair than anything else available in the market. We have a clear mission in a large and well established market and we are well funded having recently raised $4m from LightSpeed Venture Partners, Founders Fund and Max Levchin's SciFi VC. We are a small team of engineers with high quality standards that enjoy solving hard technical problems together. If that sounds appealing to you and you are searching for a meaningful mission where you can make a big impact then we want to hear from you. The Product Engineer Role Product Engineers are responsible for everything from building the dashboards, onboarding flows, and billing through to building the API itself and implementing new bank integrations alongside the Reverse Engineers on the Teller Red Team. About you You thrive in environments that afford you with high levels of responsibility and autonomy. You hold yourself and those you work with to high standards. You want to fulfil your potential to its fullest, grow as a developer and as a person to be the best you that you can be. You don’t look for excuses for why something can’t be done, you are the person who finds the way it can be done. If a skill that you don’t possess is required to complete a task you’re the kind of person who goes off and learns enough to get it done. You behave like an owner. You take total responsibility for what you work on and think of the bigger picture like a product manager would. You are results oriented and have a strong distaste for shaving yaks. You are a persuasive communicator. You are both succinct and direct. You are clear about what you are doing, why, and what you expect of others. You have strong opinions, weakly held, and the humility to change your mind according to the evidence as it presents itself. You have experience of shipping production applications, ideally written in Elixir, Erlang, or another functional programming language. That said, programming languages are more easily learned than general software engineering ability, so we’re mostly interested in the latter.

All of that running on Kubernetes clusters Highly-scalable, highly-available, cloud-native applications are key to our next phase of growth, are written to 12-factor principles and fit into our microservices architecture Cloud-related tools and services support these applications, such as Docker, Kubernetes, ElasticSearch, log management systems, and Datadog APM, to name but a few API specifications, conforming to the OpenAPI (Swagger) standard, provide a clean boundary both externally between our customers and our product, and internally between our microservices SQL, and large SQL databases, provide the persistence layer for our applications. You’ll be working with (and know the limitations of using) such large datastores Infrastructure automation is primarily owned by the infrastructure team, but you will be a consumer of their work, familiarity with AWS, Terraform and Docker is beneficial Testing approaches, including TDD, BDD and Contract Testing, all form an important part of our approach to quality assurance; ensuring that the code that we write forms products that are fit for use. We currently use RSpec and Cucumber Agile development, with teams broadly aligned with the Spotify - Squads & Tribes - model, helps us deliver incremental improvements to our products in an iterative manner. Advocating this model, and joining us on a journey of continuous improvement, is a key attribute of senior members of our teams Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines allow us to “automate all the things”, providing repeatable builds and consistent deployments GitHub, and the GitHub PR review process, forms a core part of our developer workflow, and peer reviews help share knowledge and improve quality Teamwork, and cross-team collaboration, is fundamental to the delivery of our applications. Whilst each application has an independent path to production, there will always be some activities and initiatives that span multiple teams and require cross-team collaboration. Within your team you’ll need to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, including Product Owners and QA, as part of your product development

Who are we?

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 23k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

As a Rapid NLP prototyper you will be responsible for prototyping, developing, and deploying a wide variety of applications using the cohere API. You will work directly with Nick Frosst (co-founder / CTO) as well as the rest of the eng team, in order to build out and publish demos and examples of NLP applications. You would be a good fit for this role if you have a wide breadth of technical background (front end / back end / ML / Infra), if you are passionate about building things, and if you are a self-starter and enjoy working independently.

Please Note: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first! There are no restrictions on where you can be located for this role.

If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Our Perks: 

🤝 An open and inclusive culture and work environment

🧑‍💻 Work closely with a team on the cutting edge of AI research

🦷 Full health and dental benefits, including a separate budget to take care of your mental health

We're on a mission to help the world get around on two wheels. We'd love to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal!
MEET BEELINE!Beeline is on a mission to help the world have better journeys on two wheels. Founded in 2015 by Mark and Tom, two friends who wanted to solve the problem of getting lost in London on their bikes, Beeline is now a passionate team of 20 with big ambitions to transform two wheeled journeys.
Beeline’s hardware products are beautifully designed devices to guide riders of bikes and motorcycles on their journeys. Behind these devices lies a huge amount of cutting edge software, from mobile apps built on the latest technologies and backend systems processing crowdsourced data, to machine learning routing engines and sensor fusion algorithms. 
We’re growing fast as the world embraces bikes and are expanding beyond connected hardware into app only offerings and providing our technology to other businesses guiding people on 2 wheels (e.g. dockless e-scooter operators or delivery companies). This means we need to make sure our products get out there into the world in this exciting time for two wheels…That’s where you come in!

WHO WE'RE LOOKING FORWe’re looking for a great frontend developer to lead Beeline’s website and webshop experience. You’ll bring with you relevant experience from other online brands to help take Beeline’s online presence to a whole new level. You’ll be part of the tech team but work very closely with our marketing team and our designers as well, and you’ll be at the centre of the strategy and design of the sites as well as the implementation. At Beeline we’re committed to diversity and inclusivity. Not only because it’s right and fair but because bringing together people from all walks of life adds richness that helps us be better in every way. So no matter your background, who you are or how you identify, we’ll make sure you feel at home here.  
WHAT YOU’LL BE WORKING ONBeeline.co is our shop window to the world and it’s incredibly important to us. The UK site and its regional versions are all currently built on a Shopify theme and all maintained on Github. Here are some examples of things you might work on:Replacing the current website with a headless approach using React combined with the Shopify Storefront API or Shopify Hydrogen.Implementing a new design for the product page to achieve higher ecommerce conversion ratesRestructuring the support section of the site to improve usability and reduce the inbound customer service enquiries 
IMPACT OF THE WORKTwo wheeled transport - bicycles, eScooters, eBikes, and (e)Motorcycles - is set to play a huge role in our global future, whether that be as a mode of transport or a leisure activity. Bike use is growing for good reasons – it’s healthy for mind and body, it reduces congestion, and it’s better for the planet. The trend is helped along by huge new industries in Micromobility (shared bikes/scooters) and two-wheeled delivery fleets. However, navigation for two wheels is yet to be mastered - we’re striving to be the company that does that.

WHAT IT’S LIKE TO WORK AT BEELINEWe’re a small and very close-knit group, with everyone owning their different responsibilities. People tend to very quickly feel like an important and valued member of our Beeline team; we’d love for you to feel that way too! We’re proud of our culture and we dedicate a lot of time and energy into nurturing and preserving that. We do regular socials, an annual retreat (a week in Somerset last September!), and generally try to have a great time doing our thing every day. Everyone takes their work seriously, but nobody takes themselves too seriously. That’s how we like to do things.
COVID-19 catalysed a change in the way we work and we now work with much more flexibility. We have an office in Southwark, London which is free for anyone to use as they wish, but we are principally a ‘remote-first’ company. On a normal day we would have roughly 5-7 folks in the office, 13-15 working remotely. Expect it to be the best of both the flexibility to work from home and the benefits of being able to spend quality time together too.  
WE CAN OFFER YOU:A competitive salary based on transparent benchmarking and generous options (shares)Great holiday allowance (we take a week off at Christmas in addition to 25 days holiday + public holidays and aim to get away as a company each year)Half days on Friday. We finish the working week at 2pm and you’re free to start your weekendThe opportunity to develop new skillsA supportive and fun team culture - we firmly believe that we get the most out of people when they’re happiestThe opportunity to shape the future of this young, growing companyThe potential to have real social impactCycle to work scheme 
YOU CAN OFFER US: Essentials:Around 3 years of experience with React in a professional environmentA good understanding of git version control
Nice to have:Experience with Shopify, in particular build tools such as Shopify CLI or Theme KitKnowledge of google suite functions (Google Analytics, Google Ad Words, Search Console) for analytic purposes and trackingExperience of web design, usability testing, and using/building design librariesUnderstanding of SEO principles

We’re building a bank for and with our users. A product that’s fair, transparent and a pleasure to use. We see ourselves as something more than a typical current account: we’re setting out to solve all the problems that exist around your financial life in a coherent, meaningful and delightful way.

You’ll be working on a product that is a part of day to day life for more than 5 million people already, and your work here will shape the way that people interact with their finances.

Our mobile engineers have a variety of different backgrounds

There are 15+ iOS engineers at Monzo and we’re looking for one more to join the team. We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we’d love to talk to you.

We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report .

We encourage an open and transparent working environment

You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe’s example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We default to transparency and prefer to communicate openly in Slack rather than by email or in DMs. Our blog is an excellent place to learn even more about what we do!

Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams

We have 200+ engineers out of 2,000+ people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you’ll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.

Our iOS app

At Monzo, you'll get to work with industry standard tools and technologies - and help us define what great looks like for iOS engineers.

Our app is 100% Swift, built using a Model, View, View-Model architecture (MVVM). We use Coordinators to ensure we can re-use screens wherever possible, and avoid tightly coupling one screen to another. We make heavy use of protocols and extensions throughout our app.

Our networking stack is built upon Alamofire, using a generic interface to easily de-serialise objects of a certain type, and we mirror our backend micro-service architecture by building individual services to house our API logic.

We persist objects using Realm when we need to.

Our testing stack comprises of unit tests for business logic, stubbed API tests for pseudo-integration tests, snapshot tests for UI, and XCUITest for testing user input and sequencing.

We've published some talks and blog posts about how we work:
 Working with backend services on iOS  Pushing Protocols to their Limits  The Release Mindset (how we release our apps)  What you'll be doing

This role is all about collaborating across disciplines to test hypotheses and make a difference to customers. As an iOS engineer at Monzo you'll work in a small, autonomous product squad alongside Android Engineers, Backend Engineers, User Researchers, Product Designers, Product Managers, QA Testers, Data Scientists and Business Analysts.

Your mission will depend on the squad, but currently mobile engineers are working on the core personal banking experience, paid products, lending products, business banking and internal operations. We also have a small squad dedicated to enabling other mobile engineers to move faster.

You and your team will be responsible for an overall company goal, rather than building a specific feature - you'll have the opportunity to have impact on both what we build, and how we build it.

Every week we meet as a discipline to discuss tools, techniques, problems we're encountering across the company and work together to improve our codebase and processes.

You'll report to an engineering manager who will meet with you every 2 weeks 1:1, their mission is to help you develop and grow as an engineer.

What we're looking for

We're looking for iOS engineers with strong product sensibilities. You'll care about the impact your work has on our customers, and optimise for impact rather than the number of lines of code you output.

You Should Apply If

Our open roles are for mid-level to senior iOS Engineers at present.
 You are excited about and have experience in programming in Swift  You’ve shipped and iterated on at least one app in the App Store  You have a product mindset: you care about customer outcomes and you want to make data-informed decisions  You love turning excellent design into beautiful products  You’re comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity  You have an understanding of the principles of computer science  Compensation

Our salary range for the role is £70,000 - £95,000 per annum depending on experience, plus stock options and other benefits including study leave with a learning budget, flexible hours etc. we also provide all of our engineers with the latest MacBook Pro (M1 Pro).

Logistics

This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed/remote working in the UK.

We can help you relocate to the UK & we can sponsor visas.

Please note we aren't able to support remote working outside of the UK at the moment.

We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.

Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog .

Interview Process

The ‘on-site’ Consists Of Two Rounds

Our interview process consists of a 45 min initial phone interview, a take-home code test with a call to discuss it for 45 min, and 2 hours of on-site interview that can be conducted via hangouts as well.

iOS technical

You'll meet 2 other iOS engineers. Together we'll go over some technical challenges we've faced as a company. We'll ask you to come up with designs to solve these problems, and we'll ask you questions about your experience using Swift in production.

Behavioural

You'll meet 2 Monzonauts to chat about some of the non-technical parts of being a product engineer at Monzo. These include your experience in delivery, team work, coaching/mentoring and persuasion.

At each stage you'll have an opportunity to ask us questions about what life is like at Monzo.

We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a solution together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won’t make you write code on one.

Equal Opportunity Statement

At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.

We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.
