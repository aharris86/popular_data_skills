Who are you?

We are looking for a Database Administrator (with additional data engineering projects) to join an exciting team that enables DrDoctor to process millions of patient interactions and provide our healthcare clients with the right tools to continue to meet the rising patient need.

You will play a crucial role in our cross functional team, along with business domain experts, engineers, product analysts and client delivery teams. You’ll understand data and reporting requirements from our BI. You’ll support us to meet our GDPR requirements.

As a DBA/Data Engineer you will be a key member of the product team supporting the all the databases of platform, including analytics. You will support the creation of new schemas and improve the performance of queries.

This opportunity will allow you to have a direct effect on what we do and how we do it! If you have a desire to learn and wish to accelerate your career, we can give you as much responsibility as you are ready to handle as part of a growing health tech company!

OK, That’s me, but who are you?

DrDoctor is a HealthTech company on an exciting growth trajectory. Our technology focuses on engaging patients across their healthcare journey while saving hospitals time, effort, and money.

Our Mission is that healthcare needs a reset. More people need care every day and health services struggle. Current patient engagement is a mess of disparate systems that hinder, rather than help care delivery.

Our Vision is a remote-first healthcare system, which can meet demand without sacrificing care quality. We want patients to be engaged in their care, shifting to a digital first model.

We Do That Onscale
10 million+ patients use DrDoctorWe manage over 50 million appointmentsWe work with over 35 NHS Trusts and Health Boards
We HEART the NHS and want to help it work better. We radically transform the delivery of health services to make healthcare work for everyone – for patients, doctors, administrative teams and taxpayers.

Tell me more! Who will I be working with?

But Meet Shane

In this role you really will interact with every part of the business on a daily basis, even as we grow.

'I'm Shane, and I work in the Data team within the Product group. This team is relatively new, and we manage the usual tasks around unlocking insights from various data sources. Our mission is a little different though. It's not financial figures or social media data we're crunching. This data is used to help our wonderful NHS give patients the care they need quickly and efficiently. There aren't many data jobs where you can make an important contribution to the community like this. It's a good feeling.

Also, much of what's on our future roadmaps is greenfield. That's pretty exciting. It means we need ambitious people with open minds, big imaginations and bags of drive. People who are willing to explore and learn and can collaborate and share their knowledge on projects not just with developers but people right across the DrDoctor team.

This is a company with big plans and one that is tangibly scaling-up. Pre-Covid the headcount here was under 40. That number has easily doubled since (and that includes yours truly). Our challenge is to ensure everything we build is secure, flexible and scalable, and can keep pace with a flourishing company.

Plus we're a friendly and sociable bunch of people who come from all around the world and all walks of life. And we like a laugh.'

OK, I’m interested. What experience do I need to have?

We’d Like You To Have Experience Of
Production database administration and maintenanceSQL Server workload tuning and optimisationLiaising with developers around SQL Server matters
Bonus Points For
SQL Server DevelopmentData Warehouses (with awareness of Kimball)Azure Data Factory (or similar)Power BI
We know from research and experience that candidates may not apply if they don’t feel they meet 100% of our requirements. If you don’t tick all the boxes but feel you would be a good fit, we would still love to hear from you. We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive culture!

Just to let you know too, we will need you to have the Right To Work in the UK, and as we work closely with the NHS, if we get to the stage where we make you an offer to join us, we will also need to undertake a DBS check.

We are perfect for each other, what are the next steps?

We are currently recruiting heavily and have a lot of CV’s to go through. However, we don’t wait for roles to close before going through your CV. We will be in touch in a few days to let you know if we think we might be a match, and if we are not. Unfortunately, because we get so many CV’s we are not able to send an individual response if its not a match. However, if you want more details as to why, just drop us a note and we will arrange to get some feedback over to you.

If it’s a match, then we will arrange a time to talk to you on a quick 30 minute call. It’s just an informal chat so you can relax! We will tell you more about the role, the team and why you should want to join us.

If we continue, then we will invite you in to meet the team and founders. Depending on your role we may also ask you to complete an assessment.

We get there are a lot of great roles out there, so we will make sure to get through the rounds as quickly as possible. All we ask is you keep us up to date with your plans.

I can’t wait to get started, what are the perks?

Job Description

J2 Interactive is looking for qualified candidates to help us on challenging integration and health information exchange projects utilizing InterSystems Caché, Ensemble and HealthShare. Since 2007, we've been delivering large-scale implementations for a variety of customers including small and large health systems, public RHIOs, and statewide exchanges. We also do extensive work in Caché application development both inside and outside the healthcare industry.

The roles on our implementation teams are quite diverse, and the range of skills and abilities we need to bring to these projects is very broad. The ideal candidate will possess not only the required technical knowledge and capabilities, but will need the skills necessary for designing robust and innovative solutions. We value candidates who have extremely strong communication skills and can work in a fast-paced, challenging environment.

Though our headquarters is located in Boston, USA, this is a telecommuting position open to anyone who's eligible to work in the UK.

Candidates must be willing to submit to a background check. No recruiters or third party solicitations please.

Skills Description

Candidates for this position must have at least two years’ experience with InterSystems Caché and/or Ensemble. If you don’t have this experience, it doesn’t mean there isn’t a place for you at J2 but it does mean you should apply for one of our other positions instead of this one.

We do the vast majority of our work in healthcare, so healthcare industry experience is critically important for most of our project assignments. So if you’re coming at the position as a healthcare IT expert, we’ll expect you to bring significant experience (5+ years would be ideal) in healthcare IT, preferably with a strong knowledge of healthcare integration (HL7, CCD, C-CDA, X12, etc.). Anyone possessing real experience with InterSystems HealthShare or TrakCare is going to get special consideration.

If you’re presenting yourself as more of a Caché / Ensemble application developer, then healthcare experience is not strictly necessary but the strength of your application will rest on the depth and breadth of your experience with Caché. We’re looking for people who have legit experience as a software developer and who understand object-oriented programming, service-oriented architectures, and other concepts central to developing robust, scalable, distributed applications. If you know Caché, then you know that not everyone with a MUMPS / Caché background meets this standard. If you have experience with other programming languages and environments (Java, JavaScript, JavaScript Frameworks, SQL, .NET, C#, C, C++, XSLT, XPath, XML, etc.), and particularly if you are a strong web application developer (UI layer or middleware), that’s going to be a plus. We’ve been doing a fair amount of work with AngularJS and would welcome applications from anyone who knows both Caché and Angular.

Company Description

J2 Interactive is an award-winning software development and IT consulting firm specializing in customized solutions for hospitals, labs, research institutions, and health information exchanges. Our approach to design and development is rooted in a fundamental belief that systems succeed or fail based on how well they serve the people who depend upon them. For our clients in the healthcare industry, that includes doctors, nurses, technicians, and administrative staff ... but ultimately, it means patients and their families. At J2 we get a lot of satisfaction out of helping our customers succeed, and we want people with that same commitment to getting the job done right. We’re not afraid to give people the responsibility of working directly with clients, defining project specs, and choosing implementation strategies. Our casual work environment and telecommuting options give our staff a high quality of life to go along with the technical and creative challenges of the work itself. Generally speaking, we are looking to hire full-time, salaried employees. But if you're a freelancer and want to stay that way, we're open to discussing a contract position as long as we can get a stable, predictable full-time commitment from you.

Benefits
The ability to telecommute from your home officeMinimal travel on most projectsAggressive employee profit-sharing programVoluntary pension plan with company matching up to 4% of salaryPrivate Medical Insurance paid by J2Income Protection Plan Life CoverLaptop and required software provided by J2Annual ski trip (in the Western US) that will make you wonder how you found this awesome company
If you're interested in joining our team, we invite you to submit your resume so we can take a look. We move fast ... so if you've got what we're looking for, you'll be amazed at how quickly you might have yourself a new job that you'll love.

About The Role...

From our monolithic datacenter beginnings, we’ve moved wholesale to AWS where our system runs as a set of distributed applications. We’re currently in the process of migrating those applications over to Kubernetes, and building new ones, as we further embrace a microservices architecture.

Currencycloud's software development teams independently build and deliver microservices to production, but they don’t do it alone. Our Developer Experience team provides our developers with a frictionless and straightforward path to reliable production operations. Deployment of their services must be highly automated, and future changes can be applied to services in a highly repeatable and sustainable way.

For the Developer Experience team, Currencycloud’s developers are our main customers. As such an important part of our role is to provide guidance and support around how they can best leverage the platform to meet Currencycloud’s demands.

We’re looking for someone who can help us think about our systems, their edge cases, failure modes, and life-cycles.

The details...
Support teams in their CI/CD process and encourage best practicesDesign, build and maintain solutions that enable our development community to self-serve the infrastructure and capabilities they need to build secure, scalable and reliable services and allow them to deliver them safely to productionContribute towards improvement initiatives - examples of such projects recently include:Reviewing and testing various CI/CD tooling to improve stabilityImplementing fully automated pipelines for the services we run as well as supplying the tools to execute various test types autonomouslyMigrating services from EC2 to EKSMultiple ongoing initiatives to improve platform performance and stability in light of the changing demands of our customers Build a great developer experience for people using the infrastructure and platform you operate and maintain

Skills, Knowledge & Expertise...
Kubernetes (EKS) to schedule and run our servicesAWS and its suite of products around compute, networking and storage for the vast majority of our infrastructureDatadog to monitor our applications and infrastructureIstio for our Service MeshTerraform for our infrastructure as codePact for our contract testingIdeally you'll be comfortable coding and scripting with a variety of languages (we don't mind which languages you prefer)

Why Currencycloud?

We are a remote-first company; whichever location you’re contracted to, we leave it up to you and your manager to agree on how often you come into the office. To make things easier we offer an allowance so you can create your own working space at home because we REALLY mean it when we say remote first.

Your health and well-being are of paramount importance to us, and so our jampacked employee benefits reflect this!

We offer a competitive salary, an individual learning and development budget, a pension or 401K contribution, mental health days and comprehensive health care that includes annual optical and dental allowances, access to mental health support and a monthly allowance that you can spend on anything health or wellness related!
