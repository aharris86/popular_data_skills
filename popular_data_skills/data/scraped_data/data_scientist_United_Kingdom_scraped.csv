              This position can be based in London or Madrid. Remote options are available as well across the US and EU

Our Mission

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:
World Economic Forum PioneerOne of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation LabTop startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open TalentYoung Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:
Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).

Our Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela, is a successful entrepreneur who has been recognized as one of the most distinguished leaders under the age of 40 by prestigious institutions like the World Economic Forum. Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.

Who are we?

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 23k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

              VPD is hiring a remote full-stack engineer to help develop and implement our groundbreaking cloud solution, contributing across all aspects of our app, its data, architecture and deployment.

We’re a well-funded scaleup (no VC money) with big plans to revolutionise legal pricing: our software aims to bring an end to law firms overcharging clients, arbitrary pricing, and other bad practices that have existed for years.

Our two directors are recognised world authorities in this domain, we are recognised suppliers to Thomson Reuters and Aderant Legal Software. We've successfully onboarded one of the world's largest legal teams and we're now busy preparing to deploy to some of the top 100 law firms in the UK and abroad.

Our app is powered by React, with Apollo Client for its GraphQL queries and mutations. It leverages Ant Design as the UI framework, upon which we build a mixture of UI components; some simple, some complex.

On the back-end, we're using PostgreSQL as our RDS, TypeORM as our ORM, TypeGraphQL to define the API schema, and Apollo Server to deliver the GraphQL.

Both our front and back ends are coded in TypeScript. We believe in end-to-end testing and have therefore used Playwright to handle an automated E2E test script which runs before deployments.

The work is varied, challenging, and we place equal emphasis on front and back-end; we need to deliver scheduled features, fix bugs, and respond to the needs of newly onboarded firms.

Qualities And Skills Sought
A good technical understanding of software engineering principles Adept with React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL and GraphQLProficient with SQL, TypeORM or similarAn interest in upholding data security principles and helping us choose and implement effective application architecturesAbility to unpack complex requirementsA collaborative, adaptable, user-centred approach
You may also bring - or like to learn within the role

Ant Design | TypeORM | TypeGraphQL | Apollo Client | Apollo Server | Java | CircleCI | Heroku | Auth0 | AWS | TDD | Agile | Domain-driven design (DDD) | data modelling | integration patterns

About Us

VPD has developed groundbreaking software that enables law firms to better understand and fairly price their fees. We are the authority for legal pricing and our software has attracted the attention of the largest firms in numerous countries, with a number of partnerships and customers signed.

We're now strengthening our fully-remote development team, offering a culture where you will work under your own initiative towards common goals.

Xero is a beautiful, easy-to-use platform that helps small businesses and their accounting and bookkeeping advisors grow and thrive. 

At Xero, our purpose is to make life better for people in small business, their advisors, and communities around the world. This purpose sits at the centre of everything we do. We support our people to do the best work of their lives so that they can help small businesses succeed through better tools, information and connections. Because when they succeed they make a difference, and when millions of small businesses are making a difference, the world is a more beautiful place.

Our culture & values:

We'd describe our culture as human, friendly, engaging, supportive, agile and super collaborative.

At Xero, our five values underpin everything we do: from the way we work, to how we delight and deliver to our customers.

Our values are: #Human #Ownership #Team #Challenge and #Beautiful. They create our special culture and the ‘Xero way’ that we want to foster and maintain as we scale and grow at speed. They're integral to our brand and resonate outside Xero through our ecosystem and ultimately our customers.

Whilst our Engineering team are spread across the UK and work remotely, we truly make up for this with the social interaction and 'team' environment we create.

As a permanent remote worker at Xero we want to ensure you are getting the same #beautiful employee experience as our in-office Xero’s. Permanent remote Xero’s will benefit from a virtual ergonomic work assessment and funding to assist with the improvement of your at home work setup. Xero will also fund up to 4 trips a year to your most relevant region Xero office. You are part of our #team and we want to see you thrive!

How you’ll make an impact:

You'll help build and manage software that solves engineering problems at scale. You’ll work in collaboration with other Xeros to help create and deliver beautiful software to our customers, faster. You’ll work in our UK payroll product team whose purpose is to make it easier for small business owners to pay and manage their people. We take the complexity out of payroll for employers to save them time and ensure their employees are paid correctly. You'll undertake software application development on applications in our existing suite of products, contributing to new or improved experiences for our customers, internal and external.

You’ll help maintain the standard for engineering excellence at Xero and support your team members in building products together. You’ll demonstrate leadership on best practices, and be a role model and mentor for other team members. You’ll contribute to our cross-functional environment by working towards the same objectives, using modern principles and practices. You'll be encouraged to seek clarity with technical complexities and be able to demonstrate smart ways to automate. You’ll be able to make data-driven decisions that will release value early to solve Xero customers' problems more effectively. 

The Tech we use, and how often we use it:

We use a lot of C# in .NET Core and .NET Framework. We use React and some Knockout. We use a lot of SQL Server and some no-SQL DynamoDB. We love AWS as an infrastructure partner, and TeamCity for our builds and deployments. We work in an agile way and are constantly refining how we can best live those principles to continuously deliver software that delights our customers and demonstrates our value. We strive for engineering excellence! We incorporate principles like SOLID, concepts like Domain Driven Design, proven and emerging design patterns, strong testing practices like TDD and automation, with collaborative team environments. 

Continuous engineering growth is important to us and we’re persistent in being better tomorrow than we were today. Last but not least, you will also be monitoring the impact of your releases using SumoLogic, New Relic, and CloudWatch. 

About you 

Beyond having experience with some of the specific technologies, you'll have a desire to face challenges, have a yearning for growth, and have a clear understanding of your path forward.

About Us...

Permutive is built on the core principle of responsible marketing, which includes privacy, consent and transparency. Its Audience Platform empowers publishers and advertisers to responsibly activate audiences without any third-party access to personal data.

Permutive is listed in Y Combinator's Top 150 companies of all time and is trusted by the world's largest publishers and advertisers, including News Corp, Hearst, BuzzFeed, Penske Media, Future plc, The Guardian, Vox Media, Insider, Hubert Burda Media and Condé Nast International.

About The Role...

Permutive is looking for a Software Engineer to join our Edge Mobile team to work on our Mobile and CTV SDKs, which are currently written in Swift and Kotlin. They connect millions of users to our platform and send billions of events a day.

This role will involve working closely with Product, Edge engineers, and other product teams. We're interested in someone who has high-level, pragmatic ideas on how software should be built in a product team, and we'd love for you to bring a fresh perspective to our team to help us solve problems more effectively.

The Mobile team is part of our wider Edge team, which is responsible for distributing data processing and synchronising computation state across the billions of users that run our SDKs. Our mission is to enable distributed, privacy-safe computation on the edge, without compromising the experience of the end-user, and we collaborate closely with other teams to enable them to build functionality on top of our edge platform. From a product perspective, we have a focus on enabling our customers to seamlessly integrate Permutive into their web, mobile and CTV applications.

The problem we are trying to solve

We believe that computing at the edge represents a sea change in the way technology will be built, and enabling edge computing for the Mobile ecosystem is a key part of this shift. We've built a run-time platform for edge computing, which provides an environment for distributing computation to devices. Alongside this, our SDKs provide an interface for our customers to use to interact with this environment and access the results of these computations. This has already been deployed across dozens of the world's largest web and mobile properties and is being run by millions of users.

As we move forward with our ambitious plans for the SDKs, we would love to work with someone who is curious and enjoys solving complex challenges to join alongside an existing team using the latest mobile technologies.

We'll spend time with you to help you to get familiar with the SDKs and our challenges, learning and growing into the role.

Once you're feeling comfortable and have had time to onboard with us, some questions you'll help us to answer are:
How can we improve client developer's experience with our SDKs?How can we get more clarity and visibility on the health and potential issues of our live SDKs?How can we improve our testing strategies for platform and platform-independent tests?Can we take advantage of multiplatform code? What components can we identify and rewrite as part of this strategy?How can we better manage the lifecycle of features and platform versions in deployed SDKs?

Please note - we don't expect you to know the answer to these questions already, we will work to solve them together!

The ideal candidate will have
Experience in SwiftGreat communication skills, both spoken and writtenA keen product focus and will know where to invest effort in order to derive the most value.Experience in working with RESTful APIsExperience with asynchronous functional codeA desire to solve interesting and challenging engineering problems

We'd be particularly excited if you also have...
Experience in KotlinPrevious experience in AdTech and/or CTV developmentAn interest or experience in functional programming

Salary

We take a structured, objective approach to salary-setting, which is based on market information, our compensation strategy, and your experience and capability as assessed through our interview process.

For a typical candidate with Swift experience plus most of our requirements we would likely pay £90,000 + options.

For a candidate who meets most of our bonus criteria, we'd pay up to £115,000 + options.

Benefits
Stock optionsParental Leave Policy entitling new parents up to 26 weeks of leave on full payEveryone has an annual learning budget of £2,400 which we encourage you to use to level upTime to rest and relax with unlimited paid leave (minimum expectation of 25 days annually)Extensive training and development opportunitiesCycle to work schemeAutomatic enrolment into our pension scheme from day oneFree access to Spill, our mental health partnersThe equipment and technology you need to be successful, plus a generous working from home stipend upon joining

Who are we?

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 23k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

As a Rapid NLP prototyper you will be responsible for prototyping, developing, and deploying a wide variety of applications using the cohere API. You will work directly with Nick Frosst (co-founder / CTO) as well as the rest of the eng team, in order to build out and publish demos and examples of NLP applications. You would be a good fit for this role if you have a wide breadth of technical background (front end / back end / ML / Infra), if you are passionate about building things, and if you are a self-starter and enjoy working independently.

Please Note: We have offices in Toronto, Palo Alto, and London but embrace being remote-first! There are no restrictions on where you can be located for this role.

If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

Are you a front-end developer with around 2 years of commercial experience? Are you interested in using Vue? Or maybe you would like to gain exposure to back-end development and learn transferable skills?
This front-end position is with our Dublin team although we offer a fully remote working model. Our Dublin team came from the GeoPal acquisition when they joined the Totalmobile Group in Feb 2021. GeoPal was an award-winning provider of field operations and mobile workforce management solutions.
Current StructureOur Dublin team currently employs seven front-end developers. They operate via cross-functional teams on projects that take 2-3 months to complete. Once the project is completed, the team is disbanded and new teams are formed to work on different projects. This means you will get to work with different technologies, clients, and different team members.
You will engage with project managers and work with them to help break the project down into sprints and advise them on the workload. You will rarely work directly with the client.
CultureYou would be joining a company that encourages innovation. The front-end team in Dublin put a case together for the company to move away from Ext.JS and move to Vue.JS. Developers are encouraged to set time aside in their diaries to look at new technologies and techniques that might benefit the company. Career progression is also a reality within the wider TotalMobile group.
Essential SkillsYou will need at least 2 years of commercial experience using JavaScript along with 1 year of experience using either Vue, React or Angular. Preference will be given to developers with a background in Vue. Additionally, if you had experience with Node, then great, but this is not essential as training can be provided.
How to applySend your CV via the link provided or contact our internal recruiter directly at gareth.stirling@totalmobile.co.uk.
At Totalmobile we believe in making work more productive and enjoyable by providing enterprise apps that deliver a consumer experience. We deliver field workforce management solutions for a wide range of markets including health, local government, social housing, utilities, and facilities management.

About Sano

Sano is the platform that patient-centric personalised medicine research is built on.

We help pharma, biotechs, biobanks, and patient organisations to run digital and at-home personalised medicine research that is faster, and more cost-effective than traditional approaches.

Taking part in research is currently hard to do and a poor experience for the patient. Finding out about opportunities is haphazard, and there is often little meaningful return for those who take the time and care to get involved. The result is that organisations with cutting edge theories and medicines to test, can't find the right patients to work with. To discover cures for the diseases that affect us and our families, we need to enable people to contribute to medical science, effortlessly and on their own terms. We founded Sano to enable medical research that is data-driven and puts patients at the centre of the experience.

Today, the Sano platform is helping tens of thousands of people connect to relevant research projects including clinical trials which are testing new medicines. By the end of 2022, we expect to be helping hundreds of thousands of people.

We are a team of 25 people today, so this is an exceptional chance to join early in our journey to help define our culture and the company's mission.

We work in an agile way and are constantly refining how we can best live those principles to continuously deliver software that delights our customers and demonstrates our value. We strive for engineering excellence! We incorporate principles like SOLID, concepts like Domain Driven Design, proven and emerging design patterns, strong testing practices like TDD and automation, with collaborative team environments.

 Design REST apis. Code backend services, ideally using Java, or another other server side compiled language. Develop modern front ends, ideally using React and Redux. Get their code into the cloud and support it there, ideally on AWS. Believe in clean coding, simple solutions, automated testing and continuous deployment. Like to take ownership of a feature from the original idea through to live. Think (like us) that a small number of empowered developers is the right way to deliver software.

At Monzo we’re aiming to build the best current account in the world . We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal 🚀

Our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds

We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; one of the team has a degree in Marketing; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we’d love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.

We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report .

We encourage an open and transparent working environment

You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following  Stripe’s  example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to  open source software  as much as possible. Our  blog  is a good place to learn even more about what we do!

Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams

We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you’ll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.

At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.

We Rely Heavily On The Following Tools And Technologies
 Go to write our application code (there’s an excellent interactive Go tutorial here ) Cassandra for most persistent data storage Kafka for our asynchronous message queue Envoy Proxy for RPC Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services ( Oliver , our VP Architecture, gave a great talk at KubeCon on how we use these technologies) AWS for most of our infrastructure React for internal web dashboardsWe also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to various third parties
Our product squads are truly cross-functional.

This role is all about collaborating across disciplines to test hypotheses and make a difference to customers. As a product backend engineer you’ll work in a squad alongside product managers, marketers, user researchers, designers, mobile engineers, web engineers, data analysts, business analysts, writers and more!

Together you’ll build and support a particular part of Monzo. Our product squads belong to one of four collectives (a word we use to describe self-governing business units of ~100 people). They are: Growth & Core, Borrowing, Operations and Money. They’re all looking for additional Backend Engineers right now.

The Growth & Core collective helps people to discover Monzo and make the most of it.

Growth & Core is a collective focused on different aspects of our mission to ‘make money work for everyone’ and it has four squads . They make users effortlessly financially savvy with features like Budgeting, Pots and the Salary Sorter. Many of the customer problems they solve are revenue opportunities, too – like Monzo Plus, Business Banking, and the Savings marketplace. Last year they also launched our Open Banking APIs, shipped a simpler and more future-proof navigation structure, and enabled Monzo customers to get their salary paid a day early for free! 🤑

The Borrowing collective makes borrowing money simple, fair and transparent.

We’re really proud that this fair approach to lending helps people to get what they want from life on their own terms. Squads in Borrowing have already shipped and scaled overdrafts to hundreds of thousands of Monzo customers. They’ve made it easy to take out a loan without the unfair fees or confusing pricing that you find elsewhere. They work on everything from the way borrowing works in the app, right down to how they move and account for money that our customers borrow. One of the most interesting problems they face is deciding how much to lend and to whom. The team believes that they can make access to credit fairer and more transparent.

The Operations collective is responsible for our incredible customer support.

The Operations collective looks after one of the most interesting problem spaces at Monzo: as we grow, we want to ensure that we’re using technology as effectively as possible whilst still maintaining customer service so good that you want to tell your friends. Our engineers within this area of the business help us to explore these challenges. Central to it all is Monzo Chat – a completely bespoke bit of software we’ve built from the ground up to manage chats in our app - but we’re also doing work with machine learning, and looking at how technology can more broadly support our wonderful support team (we call them COps) in other aspects.

The Money collective helps Monzo move fast and in control with our money 💰

We are the bank within the bank and are responsible for the core infrastructure and banking services you associate with Monzo. We are the Guardians of the Monzo Ledger and own everything related to our distinctive Hot Coral cards.

Engineering squads within the Money collective carry out a variety of payments and finance related work, we built our very own Mastercard processor from scratch and recently we successfully replaced a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal Gateway to reduce outages we can't control . On top of this we've been ensuring our payment schemes are compliant with key regulatory requirements such as Strong Customer Authentication ( SCA ), 3D Secure V2 ( 3DSV2 ), making sure that our core infrastructure and services will scale to support our ambitious growth plans and that we  always  know where our money is and can report accurately and reliably on it.

The financial crime at Monzo team focuses on making sure our services are a hostile environment for criminals ⛔

We tackle all financial crime together as one team, this includes money laundering, fraud, sanctions breaches, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption and tax evasion. Engineers get to work on core services that are consumed by many different products which means we have a really broad perspective.We've had some major successes in combating financial crime, most famously The Ticketmaster Breach where we spotted large-scale fraudulent activity due to a Ticketmaster data breach before Ticketmaster or other banks did.

The TechOps team

The TechOps team are challenging the traditional IT model by building a brand new people platform to automate all aspects of a Monzo staff member’s time here. We’re building an industry leading people platform to support our staff in a delightful way and to accommodate rapid growth across multiple countries. This approach will allow us to empower our staff by providing smart, efficient and powerful tools instead of relying on traditional IT systems and a horde of IT staff.

We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won’t make you write code on one.

What You Will Be Doing

As a Graduate Software Engineer, what you lack in tried and tested experience you more than make up for with energy, passion and new ideas (as well as some relevant coding education, self taught or further education, it’s what you can do that counts). That’s exactly what we are looking for. Expect learning at hyperspeed and working with incredible technologies on challenging problems. You’ll be working with some exceptional, proven software engineers who are supportive and friendly, each of which have been where you are now, so if you like the sound of what we are doing and don’t mind getting stuck into difficult tasks on day one then continue reading.

The learning and exposure to cutting edge technologies and challenges will enable you to gain experience rapidly with designing, building and refactoring robust and scalable code. We are primarily Microsoft .NET Core, React, Python and JavaScript engineers and are unafraid of hard technical challenges.

Furthermore, your lack of experience will lend itself well towards learning about effective team communication and contribution towards solving difficult problems at scale. Whilst you won’t be expected to contribute in architectural design discussions and task planning sessions, you may be expected to join in and learn from and work with our growing product management team. A graduate's role is to learn quickly by doing, and we have plenty of doing to be done.

In short, we are looking for graduate software engineers who, regardless of their past achievements, share our curiosity for learning and ambition to keep improving. We offer a clear opportunity to test your skills by delivering incredible software at scale that delivers impactful results for our customers.

Why Deliveroo?

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes.

And we're just getting started.

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

The Role
Work as part of a full stack product team to develop solutions to ensure optimal experiences for our customers, riders, and restaurantsUtilise a variety of backend technologies to build scalable productsYou'll take part in decisions related to how we undertake new projectsYou'll gather requirements and scope out projects with the rest of the team

Our skills include:

We want to emphasise that we don't expect you to meet all of the below but would love you to have experience in some of these areas.
Pride in readable, well-designed, well-tested softwareProfessional experience writing web-based applications in any language, and a willingness to quickly get up to speed on our stack (Ruby/Rails, Go, Python, Scala, or Rust"")Experience with TDD environments (RSpec, Minitest, Capybara, Selenium)Experience with relational databases (PostGreSQL, MySQL) and key-value stores (Memcache, Redis)Experience with front-end web technology, bonus points for ReactExperience with web architecture at scale (20krpm and above)Experience with PostGIS, or any geography-heavy applicationsExperience with ""NoSQL"" data backends (Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch)Experience solving logistical problems with software

Life at Deliveroo

We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Diversity

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around.

About HashiCorp

At HashiCorp, we’re building a generation-defining infrastructure software company, powered by our core principles and a growing team of talented, committed professionals working together to help organizations seamlessly transition to and operate in the cloud. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in San Francisco, 85 percent of our employees work remotely, strategically distributed around the globe. From our inception we built the company with a remote-first approach because we believe talent has no boundaries.

,

Why work at HashiCorp?

At HashiCorp, we have a set of principles that give us a shared understanding, so we can act collectively and in a consistent manner. Our core principle is one of integrity. Integrity builds trust, upon which the strongest relationships are built. When we trust others, we are more willing to be open and engage. We must foster relationships internally to create a friendly, productive, and positive environment and externally with our users, partners, and customers to drive the adoption of our tools and products.

We also value top-notch collaboration and communication skills, both among internal teams and in how we interact with our users. We take care to balance and be responsive to the needs of our open source community and our enterprise-level customers.

Engineering at HashiCorp is a remote team. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy.

Some reasons our team has said they love working at HashiCorp:
The remote-first culture gives me a lot of flexibility to balance work with other personal and family commitments. I'm able to adapt my schedule to fit in the things I've not been able to at previous jobs, without the expectation of also being always online. Everyone has been encouraging of having clear boundaries between work and non-work time.
What would you be working on?

HashiCorp’s Terraform is an open-source platform that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve production infrastructure via the command line. It codifies APIs into declarative configuration files that can be shared among team members, treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.

Terraform Integrations enable customers to use their existing platform within a Terraform Run, and leverage Terraform to manage resources exposed by their platform APIs. These integrations provide the interface and interactions between Terraform and the APIs that interact with infrastructure. Terraform Integrations are responsible for understanding APIs and exposing resources for use with Terraform.

In This Role You Can Expect To
Be responsible for the stewardship of targeted strategic integrations by supporting the internal, community, and partner contributors with guidance, supportive and constructive code reviews, documentation improvements, mentorship, tooling, and changes required to make our users successfulBuild, iterate on, and ship features to make working with Terraform a phenomenal experience for HashiCorp customers and usersContribute to various parts of our product, which consists of a Ruby on Rails backend, an Ember.js frontend, and distributed Go servicesWork on issues and improvements in strategic Terraform integrations critical to the success of HashiCorp customers and the broader community Contribute to our growing open source community Advocate for and make improvements to Terraform Cloud, Terraform Core, and the Terraform plugin SDK
