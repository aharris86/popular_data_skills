              Built on meritocracy, our unique company culture rewards self-starters and those who are committed to doing what is best for our customers.

We think of ourselves as a team, so we have teammates - not employees. We strive to attract people who are competitive, driven, and disciplined.

Brown & Brown Insurance is seeking an experienced professional to join us as a Data Analyst. This is a full time, benefits eligible remote position.

The Data Analyst will be responsible for supporting the national EBTech team in the accurate and timely movement of data between customer payroll/HCM and benefits administration software systems. Most of EBTech customers need to keep data synchronous between the benefits administration software we deploy and support, and the payroll/HCM software that the customer also utilizes. The successful completion of assigned tasks ensures that our customer’s employees receive access to, or are removed from, insurance coverage in a timely manner. In addition, chosen benefits often include payroll deductions for employees, so deductions calculated in benefits administration must be accurately reflected in payroll for proper processing. This is critical for EBTech’s ongoing success. As a Data Analyst, you are responsible for ensuring that tasks are completed on-time with high quality and timeliness. The Data Analyst will work closely with the Software Integration team and other team members in overseeing the completion of all assigned tasks.

Essential Duties And Functions
Upload payroll demographic data files into benefits administration software platforms to keep data in sync between systems.

A Little About E Source

Since 1986, E Source has focused on partnering with utilities to help their customers save electricity. That novel approach defined the art of electric end-use efficiency—better known as energy efficiency. We’ve expanded that concept to include a broader perspective of sustainability for utilities that deliver electricity, natural gas, and water.

We work to enhance relationships with the people utilities serve, achieve the next generation of savings, and lead the carbon-reduction effort. We help utilities think differently, make data useful, and learn from the best strategies across the industry. Our people, our insights, and our network help our clients and give them the assurance that the programs they implement are the most effective.

Benefits
 We offer excellent insurance packages, including medical, dental, and vision plans; company-paid life insurance; company-paid long- and short-term disability insurance; and medical and dependent-care flexible spending plans.

              We started Bloom Institute of Technology because we believe that the “traditional” model of higher education is broken. Every year, people as young as 17 years old take on tens of thousands of dollars in student debt and pray that the education they’re investing in will land them on a job on the other side.

‍

Unfortunately, traditional colleges and universities have no incentive to ensure their graduates get hired – they get paid regardless.

‍

At BloomTech, we believe there is a better way to approach education.

Instead of asking our students to bet on us, we bet on them first. This paradigm-shifting model allows us to align the incentives of the school with the incentives of our students – and we all win when our graduates succeed.

‍

We’re in this together.

If that sounds exciting to you, let’s talk. Our success depends on building teams who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we don’t just accept differences – we celebrate them. BloomTech welcomes a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups and non-traditional backgrounds who can appreciate the diverse student communities that we serve and are looking to grow into. This includes women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

We’ve expanded that concept to include a broader perspective of sustainability for utilities that deliver electricity, natural gas, and water.

We work to enhance relationships with the people utilities serve, achieve the next generation of savings, and lead the carbon-reduction effort. We help utilities think differently, make data useful, and learn from the best strategies across the industry. Our people, our insights, and our network help our clients and give them the assurance that the programs they implement are the most effective.

Benefits
 We offer excellent insurance packages, including medical, dental, and vision plans; company-paid life insurance; company-paid long- and short-term disability insurance; and medical and dependent-care flexible spending plans.  We provide a flexible time off (FTO) program; E Source employees can take as many paid days off per year as they need, with manager approval, while fulfilling their work obligations and ensuring proper coverage of their responsibilities.  We offer flexible schedules, flexible work locations, and a paid parental leave benefit.  We provide a 401(k) plan with a 3% employer match. 
The budgeted salary for this position is $75,000 to $100,000 + annual bonus (junior) or $100,000 to $130,000 + annual bonus (senior). Actual pay will be adjusted based on experience.
