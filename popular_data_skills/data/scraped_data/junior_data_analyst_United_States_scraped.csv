This role will help us drive adoption of our modern BI platform. It's almost like being a version of Sherlock Holmes and Iron Man combined, as we crush through tons of reports/dashboards transitioning to PowerBI and bringing in 3rd party data sets, solving the puzzles when data isn't adding up. The Data Quality Analys t will contribute to the design of information infrastructure and data management process to move the organization to a more sophisticated, agile, and robust target state data architecture.

Our culture and values matter to us. A lot. We’re definitely not serious but we take this stuff seriously, if you get what we mean. We want a place that is an ego-free zone. A place where good people do good things together. It shouldn’t be rocket science in workplaces, but for some reason it still is? We’re absolutely determined to be different, and we think we’re doing a pretty good job at it. We have a CEO who makes fun of himself, and who will encourage you to tell him when he is wrong. In fact, he needs people to – we all do. Supportive challenge is good, it’s how we get better. We like getting better. We also love diversity, of all kinds.
