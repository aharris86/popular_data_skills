Remote-first

Since March 2020, our Zoomers have worked remotely and reported an overall better work-life balance with more time for family and personal wellness.

At the end of 2021, LegalZoom made the official commitment to being a remote-first company. Remote-first means that there is no expectation that Zoomers come into an office for a fixed number of days outside of those employees identified as essential onsite workers. While we remain a remote-first culture, our local offices have evolved as collaboration spaces for Zoomers to meet and engage in person.

As a staff data scientist, you'll partner closely with our co-founders and Head of Product to work on the most important strategic questions that span the company. These questions can range from identifying new revenue opportunities to helping the company figure out how to accelerate growth internationally. But you'll be the one driving which questions we need to focus on.

As a staff data scientist you'll also be expected to help create a world class data team by mentoring other data scientists, showing what great data work looks like, and enabling a data driven culture.

You will be a match if:
You have at least 5 years of data science or analytics experience.

              We started Bloom Institute of Technology because we believe that the “traditional” model of higher education is broken. Every year, people as young as 17 years old take on tens of thousands of dollars in student debt and pray that the education they’re investing in will land them on a job on the other side.

‍

Unfortunately, traditional colleges and universities have no incentive to ensure their graduates get hired – they get paid regardless.

‍

At BloomTech, we believe there is a better way to approach education.

Instead of asking our students to bet on us, we bet on them first. This paradigm-shifting model allows us to align the incentives of the school with the incentives of our students – and we all win when our graduates succeed.

‍

We’re in this together.

If that sounds exciting to you, let’s talk. Our success depends on building teams who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives.

              SentiLink is building the future of identity verification in the United States. The existing ways to determine if somebody is who they claim to be are too clunky, ineffective, and expensive, but we believe strongly that the future will be 10x better.

We’ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Already our real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, beginning with financial services. We’ve recently raised a $70M Series B round, led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products. We’ve earned coverage and awards from TechCrunch, CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and others.

Our mission is to improve the health of underserved communities. Importantly, our solutions are designed specifically for Medicaid and lower-income Medicare beneficiaries, and we meet our members where they are, bringing care into the home and neighborhoods through our community-based care teams and Virtual Care offerings.

In close collaboration with community-based organizations, local providers, and leading health plans, we are reorganizing the health system to focus on what matters to our members. Equipped with world-class, custom care delivery technology, we deliver personalized primary care, behavioral health, and social services to deliver a radically better experience of care for every member and community we serve.

Over the next year, we’ll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community.

Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community.

Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

              For one of our clients we are looking for a freelance Data Scientist

Description

We are embarking on two separate Data Science topics (Deviations Recurrence Check, Deviations Trending) in our project that seek to employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) + clustering algorithms to group similar records together in our Global Quality management system (QMS).

The contractor will receive the entire data set out of the QMS for the fulfillment of the services

The Deviations Recurrence Check seeks to replace the existing manual process whereby users determine whether or not a problem is recurrent. For example, for each new deviation, the Deviations workflow user must determine if this deviation is related to existing deviations in order to ascertain whether or not a problem is ongoing. From the QMS perspective, when the user has the basic, required fields for a new deviation filled out, they would click a button that fires a web service using the results of the clustering algorithm to return a list of similar Deviations for user review purposes.

The goal of this Deviations Recurrence Check project is to give our users a function that associate a current/new deviation with existing deviations in order to determine if a problem continues to occur. For example, if I have a deviation focused on broken tablets, we want the function to find all records related to the problem (or: trend) broken tablets in order to determine if this a new problem or continuing problem. By extension, we could use this information to determine if a CAPA was effective.

The contractor needs to employ a clustering algorithm(s)
 by checking different algorithm methods based on the contractor’s experiences and best practices, by considering that QMS system has multiple language content (for example long-text fields) for sematic processing by proposing drafts which needs presented to the project team for review and usability by adapting the draft based on the delivered feedback from the project team by handing over the final version to final approval by project team.
The Deviations Trending project seeks to find problems in the sea of data that is QMS. We envision a weekly/nightly-retrained model that analyzes the complete set of quality data (Deviations, Complaints, Audits, Investigations, OOX, Supplier Qualifications, Events, Non-Conformities, OOXs) in order to identify problem trends (e.g., broken tablets caused by a specific model of machine). We want to achieve primary cluster group which we are able to drill down to secondary or third cluster groups. Perform a clustering algorithm on the dataset to divide them into groups of problems/trends. Our plan is to use HDBSCAN to three in order to get very granular trends. The contractor will receive an example of the clustering levels. The overarching goal is to automatically analyze our QMS data and find abnormalities which cannot be easily identified with simple search functionality in the QMS.

The contractor needs to employ a clustering algorithm(s)
 by checking algorithm methods based on the contractor’s experiences and best practices, by clustering records in scope of algorithm using previously defined key words over period of time ( e.g. we found 50 “broken tablet” records in the last 12 months).and counting clustered records (e.g. 5 records in January, 7 in Feb, 8 in Mar, 10 in Apr, etc. by proposing drafts which needs presented to the project team for review and usability by adapting the draft based on the delivered feedback from the project team by handing over the final version to final approval by project team.
Skillset
 Data-oriented personality Proficiency in using query languages Excellent understanding of machine learning techniques, and algorithms (e.g. HDBSCAN, KNN, K-means) Excellent understanding of natural language processing-semantic analysis Experience with common data science toolkits, Great communication skills
Project-/Budget-/Team Responsibility

Next there will be a technical assessment tailored to how you best like to work (e.g. take home or live). The final stage would be to meet (2-4) other members of the team via video conference for additional conversations about your approach to collaboration, your relevant experience to current projects, and alignment with our values. All in, you can expect the time commitment for this stage to be 3-4 hours of synchronous interaction, scheduled to fit your needs. If you complete interviews, we will provide a decision or clear next step within five business days. We are ready to hire as soon as we find the right candidate. We can’t wait to meet you!

              For one of our clients we are looking for a freelance Data Scientist

Description

We are embarking on two separate Data Science topics (Deviations Recurrence Check, Deviations Trending) in our project that seek to employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) + clustering algorithms to group similar records together in our Global Quality management system (QMS).

The contractor will receive the entire data set out of the QMS for the fulfillment of the services

The Deviations Recurrence Check seeks to replace the existing manual process whereby users determine whether or not a problem is recurrent. For example, for each new deviation, the Deviations workflow user must determine if this deviation is related to existing deviations in order to ascertain whether or not a problem is ongoing. From the QMS perspective, when the user has the basic, required fields for a new deviation filled out, they would click a button that fires a web service using the results of the clustering algorithm to return a list of similar Deviations for user review purposes.

The goal of this Deviations Recurrence Check project is to give our users a function that associate a current/new deviation with existing deviations in order to determine if a problem continues to occur. For example, if I have a deviation focused on broken tablets, we want the function to find all records related to the problem (or: trend) broken tablets in order to determine if this a new problem or continuing problem. By extension, we could use this information to determine if a CAPA was effective.

The contractor needs to employ a clustering algorithm(s)
 by checking different algorithm methods based on the contractor’s experiences and best practices, by considering that QMS system has multiple language content (for example long-text fields) for sematic processing by proposing drafts which needs presented to the project team for review and usability by adapting the draft based on the delivered feedback from the project team by handing over the final version to final approval by project team.
The Deviations Trending project seeks to find problems in the sea of data that is QMS. We envision a weekly/nightly-retrained model that analyzes the complete set of quality data (Deviations, Complaints, Audits, Investigations, OOX, Supplier Qualifications, Events, Non-Conformities, OOXs) in order to identify problem trends (e.g., broken tablets caused by a specific model of machine). We want to achieve primary cluster group which we are able to drill down to secondary or third cluster groups. Perform a clustering algorithm on the dataset to divide them into groups of problems/trends. Our plan is to use HDBSCAN to three in order to get very granular trends. The contractor will receive an example of the clustering levels. The overarching goal is to automatically analyze our QMS data and find abnormalities which cannot be easily identified with simple search functionality in the QMS.

The contractor needs to employ a clustering algorithm(s)
 by checking algorithm methods based on the contractor’s experiences and best practices, by clustering records in scope of algorithm using previously defined key words over period of time ( e.g. we found 50 “broken tablet” records in the last 12 months).and counting clustered records (e.g. 5 records in January, 7 in Feb, 8 in Mar, 10 in Apr, etc. by proposing drafts which needs presented to the project team for review and usability by adapting the draft based on the delivered feedback from the project team by handing over the final version to final approval by project team.
Skillset
 Data-oriented personality Proficiency in using query languages Excellent understanding of machine learning techniques, and algorithms (e.g. HDBSCAN, KNN, K-means) Excellent understanding of natural language processing-semantic analysis Experience with common data science toolkits, Great communication skills
Project-/Budget-/Team Responsibility
 No only dedicated to the data science tasks
Language
 English (must), German(not mandatory)
Start: ASAP

Duration: 7 month+

Location: remote

Capacity: 25 hours/week

About This Position

At FiscalNote, we build platforms that connect people to their government, and our Data Science team builds robust machine learning engines to make sure people can find the right information at the right time. As a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer, you’ll help scale and improve our data processing and analysis systems to productionize and implement highly scalable pipelines for our various data science services, including our natural language processing (NLP), search and information retrieval, recommendation engine, and knowledge graph technologies. You’ll work closely with our researchers, designers, and engineers to define performant solutions to complex open-ended problems, and play a critical role in delivering them to the thousands of organizations that depend on FiscalNote.

About The Team

The Research and Development (R&D) Department at FiscalNote is where the magic happens. The Department includes the Product, Data Science, Professional Services, and Technology Teams. These teams work together to develop and deliver solutions to FiscalNote’s clients. The FiscalNote Data Science team builds statistical, NLP, and ML-enabled services for intelligent data aggregation, manipulation, augmentation, and generation. Our team has a wealth of diverse life and career experiences that allow us to think outside of the box and ahead of the curve. We enjoy ending meetings by discussing our favorite theorems or nitpicking the latest news article on political models. You'll get the opportunity to work at an institution pushing the boundaries of open data transparency while collaborating with some of the industry’s brightest engineers and data scientists to devise, nurture, and implement cutting-edge solutions to continuously evolving engineering obstacles.

About You

You are someone who loves to work on ambitious projects and pursues creative technological solutions to generalize patterns, extract connections, and surface relevant information across disparate datasets. You have experience in writing and extending machine learning code and related data services to serve multiple product use cases. You are passionate about code quality, continuous delivery, testing, and observability; frequently collaborating with team members to implement shared development patterns, thus enabling all to work more efficiently.

You have a working expertise in cloud infrastructure and are excited about productionizing research to push the bounds of people’s expectations. You are energized by ambiguity and enjoy finding optimizations in an ever-changing environment. You like working in an environment with multiple tech stacks. You apply an iterative development process, building a system that works end-to-end quickly before improving on it more deeply. You get a rush when you successfully orchestrate and automate several complex systems to work together.

You’re capable of working with ambiguity in a supportive but autonomous environment and are excited about solving complex problems by distilling them into simple solutions that work. You ground your work in software development frameworks while creating solutions that deliver the best results for user experience (including developer experience). Along the way, you’re comfortable proposing well-thought-out solutions and architectures to both technical and non-technical audiences, taking in stakeholder feedback while advocating for data science approaches that clearly demonstrate actionable, meaningful, and scalable solutions for business problems.

What To Expect In This Position
As an individual contributor on the data science team, you will collaborate with our data scientists, data engineers, and application engineers to build and extend our core back-end data systems to support a variety of use cases from analyzing search data, optimizing ranking algorithms, running controlled experiments, building scalable, high-performance models, and orchestrating data pipelines using various NLP, ML, and information retrieval techniques.You will participate in the full development cycle to design and deploy services to efficiently automate and productionize research solutions — integrating features that evaluate model quality, monitor drift and performance, provide interpretable assessments of recommendations or other model outputs.You will design processes to initiate validation and retraining and autonomously incorporate human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms into production workflows.You will marshal various components of data systems from storage to access in order to connect large amounts of historical data from relational and graph databases, custom APIs, and server-side applications.You will partake in operational responsibility for data science services, performing analysis on infrastructure logs to troubleshoot issues and identify system failures and monitor data quality and event logs to estimate model performance.You will implement standards for optimization, testing, and tooling; recommending team best practices for deploying infrastructure (Databricks, Neo4j, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes) to support data scientists in the delivery of machine learning models.You will work across teams to ensure cohesion and collaboration across R&D functions (Devops, Engineering, QA, Data, etc.), explaining model applications for various user needs and advocating for data science solutions while keeping engineering quality and long-term design trade-offs in mind. 
What Sets You Apart
3-5 years of experience as a Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, or Data EngineerExperience in the software development industry deploying ML-based services integrated via web applications, microservices, and data pipelines into production cloud environments Firm grasp of software engineering concepts and frameworks, such as OOP, various data structures (queues, trees, graphs, multi-dimensional arrays), computability and complexity, memory and cache managementKnowledge of data pipelines and RESTful APIs (including Swagger/OpenAPI)Experience with Python-based applications and codebases, preferably familiarity with libraries for machine learning (e.g. sklearn) and NLP (e.g. Spacy)Strong understanding of machine learning (feature engineering, feature selection, optimization algorithms) and natural language processing (TFIDF, text classification, and word embeddings), demonstrated by the ability to dig deep into practical problems and choose the right ML method to solve themExperience with search engines, information retrieval systems, recommendation engines, personalization and ranking algorithms, bandits, reinforcement learning, or graph analytics is a plusExperience developing solutions with AWS tooling (S3, SSM, ECS, CodeDeploy)Experience with or willingness to learn Configuration Management and Cloud Provisioning Tools (at least one or more of the following - Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, Github Actions, CircleCI, CloudFormation)Familiarity with combining data across two or more different data stores and systems (PSQL, Oracle DB, Elasticsearch, Neo4j, Redis, Redshift, RMQ)Experience with batch-oriented distributed processing systems like Spark and Databricks is a plusStreaming platform (Kafka, Kinesis, Confluent) integration experience is a plusKnowledge of government or public policy datasets is a plus
