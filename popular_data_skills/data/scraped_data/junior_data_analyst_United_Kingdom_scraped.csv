You will design, develop, and operate data integration pipelines to provide high quality datasets for end user, analytical, and machine learning use-cases.

You will bring a deep understanding of software engineering best practices, such as proper use of source control, end to end testing process, and automated deployment mechanism to build a high quality data platform.

Job Responsibilities: A day in the life of a Data Engineer

Infura is building a data platform to serve the needs of data scientists, business analysts, and end users. You will be collaborating with the product organization, data scientists, and business analysts to build both the underlying platform as well as data pipelines. Data pipelines will encompass both large-scale batch processing as well as real-time / stream data pipelines. You will design, develop, and operate data integration pipelines to provide high quality datasets for end user, analytical, and machine learning use-cases.

You will bring a deep understanding of software engineering best practices, such as proper use of source control, end to end testing process, and automated deployment mechanism to build a high quality data platform. While we have existing systems that require support and maintenance, you will also provide expertise to multiple teams at Infura by acting as a subject matter expert on best practices, tooling, and data engineering practices.

Required Skills

First and foremost, we want our data engineers to be great software engineers with a passion for writing high quality code. You appreciate agile software processes, data-driven development, reliability, and responsible experimentation. The ability to be pragmatic and articulate tradeoffs between a perfect solution and a working solution will make you successful in this role. The ideal candidate will have strong experience with various OLTP and OLAP databases, row and columnar oriented storage formats, ELT vs ETL processing, data lakes, and data warehousing.

Using strong programming skills in a language such as Python, Scala, Java, or Go, you have built production quality ETL pipelines at scale using Spark, Hadoop or similar framework. Ideally, you will have worked with modern data stores: AWS S3 based data lakes, AWS Redshift, or Snowflake. We are looking for a senior level candidate that can understand requirements, work autonomously, and communicate effectively. If taking ownership of scoping problems and delivering pragmatic solutions sounds interesting, this is the role for you

Bonus points for:

We use Druid, so any practical experience with this would be a bonus. Deep experience with data engineering in the AWS ecosystem, experience with orchestration tools (such as Airflow) or experience with infrastructure management tools such as terraform is beneficial. If you don’t check these boxes, don’t sweat it. We’d love to hear from you.

About Infura

Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.

We believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.

Some things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.

What You’ll Do

Infura delivers blockchain API access at internet scale. Look forward to applying the techniques and scaling tricks you’ve learned over your career to the emerging blockchain technology set. Using GoLang, you will build out system APIs, daemons, and other such microservices to support our high volume APIs and our customer facing frontends. You will analyze and optimize performance in high-traffic internet applications to deliver the best experience to the engineers we serve.

Architect and design systems that provide reliable, scalable access to various blockchains and decentralized networks. Collaborate with an experienced team of senior engineers to build an infrastructure that can service a growing number of developers and projects that are building for the blockchain. The systems you build will be powering the innovation happening in the web3 world.

Would be great if you brought this to the role
Ideally you have 5+ years of experience focussed on backend engineering, systems engineering, or scaling web services. GoLang is the primary language at Infura and experience with it is preferred, but deep experience with any strongly typed languages supporting concurrency would be sufficient. Infura works with open source stacks, so direct experience with open source technologies such as Linux, Docker, Redis, RDBMS and NoSQL storage systems. Experience with distributed systems is a bonus. A natural curiosity, thirst for knowledge, and interest in diving into blockchain and its complex code bases will help you succeed in this role. Our most successful engineers have a constant desire to improve, refine, and take things higher. Great communication and proven abilities to work in a team setting (on premises or fully remote). 

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our remote-friendly, energetic start-up environment—apply anyway. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role. We are simply looking for amazing people who share in our vision for making great things with great people.

ConsenSys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

              About Teller Teller is a banking API with a hard technical USP. Whilst other banking APIs screen scrape html pages, we reverse engineer banks apps to discover their secret API contracts and then implement clients for them. This approach means our API enables our customers to build applications that connect with their users’ bank accounts in a manner that is many more times reliable, predictable, performant, and fair than anything else available in the market. We have a clear mission in a large and well established market and we are well funded having recently raised $4m from LightSpeed Venture Partners, Founders Fund and Max Levchin's SciFi VC. We are a small team of engineers with high quality standards that enjoy solving hard technical problems together. If that sounds appealing to you and you are searching for a meaningful mission where you can make a big impact then we want to hear from you. The Product Engineer Role Product Engineers are responsible for everything from building the dashboards, onboarding flows, and billing through to building the API itself and implementing new bank integrations alongside the Reverse Engineers on the Teller Red Team. About you You thrive in environments that afford you with high levels of responsibility and autonomy. You hold yourself and those you work with to high standards. You want to fulfil your potential to its fullest, grow as a developer and as a person to be the best you that you can be. You don’t look for excuses for why something can’t be done, you are the person who finds the way it can be done. If a skill that you don’t possess is required to complete a task you’re the kind of person who goes off and learns enough to get it done. You behave like an owner. You take total responsibility for what you work on and think of the bigger picture like a product manager would. You are results oriented and have a strong distaste for shaving yaks. You are a persuasive communicator. You are both succinct and direct. You are clear about what you are doing, why, and what you expect of others. You have strong opinions, weakly held, and the humility to change your mind according to the evidence as it presents itself. You have experience of shipping production applications, ideally written in Elixir, Erlang, or another functional programming language. That said, programming languages are more easily learned than general software engineering ability, so we’re mostly interested in the latter.

Our hosting stack:
● Languages: Python, HCL, YAML, bash/shell scripts. ● Products: GCP, Kubernetes, Microk8s/K3s/Minikube, DataDog, Sentry, Semaphore. ● Tools: Helm, Terraform, Bazel, Ansible, Skaffold.
Who are we looking for?
● Experienced engineer with delivering on-premise products based on Kubernetes. ● Experience developing and deploying complex products and services built on a polyglot of languages and technologies. ● Deep knowledge of our hosting stack and surrounding ecosystem. ● Ability to communicate well with, and support other members of the team ● Experience sharing knowledge. ● Good working knowledge of Linux, git and the command-line. ● Committed to high engineering standards.
Experience with any of these would be ideal:
● Experience in developing in Python. ● Attitude of continuous improvement. ● Can design and communicate complex software architectures. ● Familiarity with relational and NoSQL databases. ● Worked in a security function. ● Google-fu. ● Fluency in another spoken language. ● The tactical mastery of Iron Man. ● The detective skills of Miss Marple. ● The situational awareness of Samus.

● Living in the United Kingdom. Working from other countries is possible, via special arrangement. ● Must be eligible to work in the UK. ● Available for at least 4 days a week, preferably full-time.
What do we offer?
● Challenging work in an interesting field with some awesome technology. ● Being part of a fast-growing company with an energetic and dedicated team. ● A culture focused on delivering high quality code while having fun. ● Competitive salary and share options. ● Generous equipment budget so our engineers work with the best tools available. ● Pension and flexible holiday arrangements.
